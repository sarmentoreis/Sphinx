Cross-referencing documents
============================



    Link to the specified document; the document name can be specified in absolute or relative fashion. For example, if the reference ":doc:" "`"parrot"`" occurs in the document sketches/index, then the link refers to sketches/parrot. If the reference is ":doc:" "`"/people"`" or ":doc:" "`"../people"`", the link refers to people.
    If no explicit link text is given (like usual: ":doc:" "`"Monty Python members </people>"`"), the link caption will be the title of the given document.
